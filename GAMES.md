# 🎮 Games Guide

All games are compiled to WebAssembly from [nbsdgames](https://github.com/abakh/nbsdgames) (CC0 public domain).
They run entirely in Node.js — no native binaries or C compiler needed.

Only **turn-based** games are included, perfect for playing during pauses while waiting for Copilot.

## Universal Controls

All games share these common controls:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Arrow keys | Move cursor / navigate |
| W / ↑ | Move up |
| A / ← | Move left |
| S / ↓ | Move down |
| D / → | Move right |

## Fifteen Puzzle

**Similar to:** 15-Puzzle, Sliding Puzzle

Slide numbered tiles on a grid to arrange them in numerical order.
The empty space allows adjacent tiles to be slid into position.

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Arrow keys / WASD / HJKL | Move cursor to a tile |
| Enter | Slide the selected tile toward the empty space |

**Goal:** Arrange all tiles in ascending order (1, 2, 3, ...) with the empty space in the bottom-right corner.

**Tip:** Work row by row from top to bottom. Get the first row in place, then the second, etc.

---

## Mines

**Similar to:** Minesweeper (Windows)

Uncover cells on a grid without hitting any hidden mines.
Numbers reveal how many mines are adjacent to that cell.

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Arrow keys / WASD / HJKL | Move cursor |
| Enter | Reveal a cell |
| Space | Flag/unflag a cell as a mine |

**Goal:** Reveal all safe cells. Use the number clues to deduce where mines are hiding.

**Tip:** Start from the edges. If a "1" has only one unrevealed neighbor, that neighbor is a mine.

---

## Sudoku

**Similar to:** Sudoku

Fill a 9×9 grid so every row, column, and 3×3 box contains the digits 1-9 exactly once.

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Arrow keys / WASD / HJKL | Move cursor |
| 1-9 | Place a digit |
| Space / 0 | Clear a cell |

**Goal:** Complete the grid with valid digits. No repeats in any row, column, or box.

**Tip:** Look for rows/columns/boxes that are almost complete — they have the fewest possibilities.

---

## Reversi

**Similar to:** Othello

Place discs to capture your opponent's pieces by flanking them.

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Arrow keys / WASD / HJKL | Move cursor |
| Enter | Place a disc |

**Goal:** Have the most discs of your color when the board is full. A valid move must flip at least one opponent disc.

**Tip:** Corners are the most valuable positions — they can never be flipped. Avoid giving your opponent corner access.

---

## Checkers

**Similar to:** Draughts, English Checkers

Move diagonally and jump over opponent pieces to capture them.

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Arrow keys / WASD / HJKL | Move cursor |
| Enter | Select piece, then select destination |

**Goal:** Capture all opponent pieces or block them from moving. Pieces that reach the far side become "kings" and can move backward.

**Tip:** Keep your back row intact as long as possible to prevent opponent kings.

---

## SOS

**Similar to:** Tic-Tac-Toe (extended variant)

Take turns placing 'S' or 'O' on a grid to form the sequence S-O-S.

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Arrow keys / WASD / HJKL | Move cursor |
| S | Place an 'S' |
| O | Place an 'O' |

**Goal:** Form more S-O-S sequences (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) than your opponent.

**Tip:** Try to set up positions where placing one letter creates multiple S-O-S patterns at once.

---

## Battleship

**Similar to:** Battleship (board game by Milton Bradley)

Take turns firing at a grid to find and sink your opponent's hidden ships.

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Arrow keys / WASD / HJKL | Move targeting cursor |
| Enter | Fire at the selected cell |

**Goal:** Sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.

**Tip:** When you get a hit, fire at adjacent cells to find the rest of the ship. Ships are always straight (horizontal or vertical).

---

## Memoblocks

**Similar to:** Concentration, Memory Game, Pexeso

Flip cards to find matching pairs.

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Arrow keys / WASD / HJKL | Move cursor |
| Enter | Flip a card |

**Goal:** Match all pairs with the fewest flips possible. Two cards are shown briefly — remember their positions!

**Tip:** Systematically work through the grid. Focus on remembering the first few cards you flip.

---

## Technical Notes

### How WASM Games Work

Each game is a C program originally using ncurses for terminal I/O. We compile them to WebAssembly using Emscripten with a custom ncurses shim (`wasm/curses.h`) that maps all curses calls to ANSI escape codes:

- `initscr()` → enters alternate screen buffer
- `mvaddch()` / `mvprintw()` → ANSI cursor positioning + output
- `getch()` → async stdin read via Emscripten ASYNCIFY
- Colors → ANSI 16-color escape sequences
- Box drawing → ASCII fallback characters

### Platform Support

The WASM games run on any platform with Node.js 18+:
- ✅ Linux
- ✅ macOS
- ✅ Windows (via Windows Terminal, PowerShell, or WSL)
- ✅ Any terminal emulator supporting ANSI escape codes

# Adding Custom Games

You can add your own terminal games to `copilot-fun` by creating single-file Node.js scripts in `~/.copilot-fun/games/`.

## 1. Create the Directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.copilot-fun/games
```

## 2. Create your Game Script

Create a `.js` file (e.g., `pong.js`). It **must** start with metadata header comments for `copilot-fun` to recognize it:

```javascript
// @game.id pong
// @game.name Pong
// @game.desc Classic paddle ball game
// @game.controls W/S to move paddle
// @game.goal Score more points than the opponent
// @game.similar Pong (Atari)

// Game code follows...
```

### Required Metadata
- `@game.id`: Unique identifier (must match the filename without `.js`).
- `@game.name`: Display name in the menu (max 16 chars).

### Optional Metadata
- `@game.desc`: Short description shown in the menu (max 36 chars).
- `@game.controls`: Explained in the game details section.
- `@game.goal`: What the player needs to achieve.

## 3. Game Architecture

Your game runs as a standalone Node.js process spawned by `copilot-fun`.

### Environment Variables
- `process.env.LINES`: Terminal height (excluding the status bar).
- `process.env.COLS`: Terminal width.

### Requirements
- **Single File**: No local imports or external `npm` dependencies.
- **Raw Mode**: Use `process.stdin.setRawMode(true)` for keyboard input.
- **ANSI Output**: Use ANSI escape codes written to `process.stdout`.
- **Exit Cleanly**: The game should exit with `process.exit(0)` when finished.
- **No `q` or `ESC` Handling**: These keys are intercepted by the `copilot-fun` wrapper to quit or pause the game.

## Minimal Template

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
// @game.id skeleton
// @game.name Skeleton Game
// @game.desc A minimal game template

const ROWS = parseInt(process.env.LINES) || 23;
const COLS = parseInt(process.env.COLS) || 80;
const CSI = '\x1b[';

let playerX = Math.floor(COLS / 2);
let playerY = Math.floor(ROWS / 2);

function render() {
  process.stdout.write(`${CSI}2J${CSI}H${CSI}?25l`); // Clear screen & hide cursor
  process.stdout.write(`${CSI}${playerY};${playerX}H${CSI}32m@${CSI}0m`);
  process.stdout.write(`${CSI}${ROWS};1H${CSI}2mArrow keys: move | Any other key: quit${CSI}0m`);
}

process.stdin.setRawMode(true);
process.stdin.resume();
process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8');
process.stdin.on('data', (key) => {
  if (key === '\x1b[A') playerY = Math.max(1, playerY - 1);
  else if (key === '\x1b[B') playerY = Math.min(ROWS, playerY + 1);
  else if (key === '\x1b[C') playerX = Math.min(COLS, playerX + 1);
  else if (key === '\x1b[D') playerX = Math.max(1, playerX - 1);
  else process.exit(0);
  render();
});

// Show cursor on exit
process.on('exit', () => process.stdout.write('\x1b[?25h'));

render();
```
